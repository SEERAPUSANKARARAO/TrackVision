# TrackVision

TrackVision is a sophisticated object recognition and tracking application that uses the YOLOv8 model to detect and track objects (specifically people) in video streams. The project includes a Streamlit dashboard for interactive visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- OpenCV
- Pandas
- NumPy
- PIL
- cvzone
- ultralytics

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/TrackVision.git
   cd TrackVision
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. **Running the main script:**

   ```sh
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Running the Streamlit app:**

   ```sh
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```

### Project Structure Details

- **main.py**: This script processes video files using the YOLOv8 model for object detection and the tracker for tracking people across frames. It displays the output with bounding boxes and counts of people moving up and down.

- **streamlit_app.py**: A Streamlit app for uploading video files and visualizing object detection and tracking results in an interactive dashboard. It allows users to upload a new video, which replaces any existing video in the `uploaded_videos` directory.

- **src/tracker.py**: Contains the tracking algorithm that assigns unique IDs to detected objects and tracks their movements across frames.

### Example

1. Upload a video through the Streamlit interface.
2. The app will process the video and display the results, showing the count of people moving up and down.
